# Description
TTP boot camp HM
We designed and built a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.
The API should handle CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for a specific resource.
Each person created a sample resource directly in the server.js file instead of using a database.

# language 
Node.js, Express.JS
